## 22. Performance

**Requirements:** NFR-PER-01, NFR-PER-02

### 22.1 Bulk Import Performance

**Prerequisite:** Generate a test CSV with 1000+ rows. Ensure referenced studies, sample types, and boxes exist.

```
BarcodeID,LegacyID,StudyCode,SampleType,CollectionDate,BoxLabel,PositionRow,PositionCol
TEST-0001,,STUDY1,Plasma,2025-01-01,BOX-001,1,1
TEST-0002,,STUDY1,Plasma,2025-01-01,BOX-001,1,2
...
```

- [ ] **TC-PRF-02:** Click Commit — verify import completes in < 30 seconds for 1000 rows.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-03:** Verify no browser timeout or server error.

**If too slow:** Check if per-row `AnyAsync` position checks are the bottleneck. Consider pre-loading all occupied positions for referenced boxes. Consider wrapping commit in a single transaction with `AddRange`.

### 22.2 Search Performance

**Prerequisite:** Seed the database with 1000+ specimen records.

- [ ] **TC-PRF-04:** Search by barcode substring — verify results in < 2 seconds.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-05:** Filter by study — verify results in < 2 seconds.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-06:** Filter by sample type — verify results in < 2 seconds.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-07:** Combined filters (barcode + study + type) — verify results in < 2 seconds.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-08:** Pagination: click through all pages — verify each page loads in < 2 seconds.

**If too slow:** Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the PostgreSQL query:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM "tbl_Specimens"
WHERE "BarcodeID" LIKE '%TEST%' AND "StudyID" = 1
ORDER BY "SpecimenID" LIMIT 25 OFFSET 0;
```
Verify indexes are applied via `dotnet ef database update`. Note: `LIKE '%substring%'` cannot use btree indexes, but `LIKE 'prefix%'` will.

### 22.3 Database Indexes

Verify the following indexes exist (migration `AddSearchPerformanceIndexes`):

- [ ] **TC-PRF-09:** Index on `tbl_Specimens.Status`.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-10:** Index on `tbl_Specimens.StudyID`.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-11:** Index on `tbl_Specimens.SampleTypeID`.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-12:** Unique index on `tbl_Specimens.BarcodeID`.
- [ ] **TC-PRF-13:** Unique index on `tbl_Specimens.(BoxID, PositionRow, PositionCol)`.

  /var/backups/stasis/stasis_20260312_020000.dump

# Restore specific table only
pg_restore -U stasis_app -d stasis --table=tbl_Specimens \
  /var/backups/stasis/stasis_20260312_020000.dump
```

### 23.4 Test Checklist
