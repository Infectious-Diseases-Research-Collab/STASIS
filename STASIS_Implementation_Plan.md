## Purpose

This plan translates the requirements in `system_requirements.md` into a practical delivery roadmap based on the current codebase. It is intended to be used during active development, not as a generic draft.

## Current Implementation Snapshot

### Already Implemented

- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app structure, authentication, and role-enabled Identity configuration
- Forced-authentication application flow with password-change enforcement
- Admin user seeding in `Program.cs` (password read from `AdminSeedPassword` configuration key)
- User administration: list users, create users, edit roles/departments, reset passwords
- Core data models and DbContext fully aligned with the PostgreSQL schema
- EF Core migrations (`Migrations/`) as the source of truth for schema management
- Sample list page with paging, barcode filter, study filter, sample type filter, and expandable location details
- PostgreSQL provider configuration, bootstrap script, and developer smoke test checklist in README

### Partially Implemented

- Navigation and page shells exist for samples, boxes, shipments, audit, and lab setup, but many handlers are placeholders
- Shipment-related entities exist, but shipment workflows are not implemented in the UI or services

### Not Implemented

- Sample creation and bulk import workflows
- Box search, placement, movement, and re-boxing workflows
- Audit trail capture logic
- Shipment request import, approval, staging, shipping, and manifests
- Discard approval workflow
- Filter paper and plasma business rules beyond a few model fields
- Automated tests

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Complete | Implemented and visible in the current codebase |
| In Progress | Started, but missing required behavior or validation |
| Not Started | No meaningful implementation yet |
| Blocked | Depends on an earlier architectural or data decision |

---

## Phase 0: Stabilize the Baseline

**Goal:** Ensure the current application is a reliable starting point before feature work expands.

| Order | Req ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 0.1 | N/A | Reconcile EF models with PostgreSQL bootstrap schema | Complete | All SQL tables and columns are represented in the C# models and `StasisDbContext`. Models and schema are fully in sync. |
| 0.2 | N/A | Adopt EF Core migrations for schema changes | Complete | `Migrations/20260303031801_InitialCreate` generated from current models. Use `dotnet ef migrations add` for all future schema changes. See README for how to apply to a new or existing database. |
| 0.3 | N/A | Remove hard-coded admin seed password from runtime startup | Complete | Password now read from `AdminSeedPassword` configuration key (user secrets / env var). App logs a warning and skips seeding if the key is absent. |
| 0.4 | N/A | Add developer smoke test checklist to README | Complete | Section 6 added to `README.md` with build, database, authentication, and core functionality checks. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] The PostgreSQL schema matches the app model
- [x] New schema changes are made through migrations
- [x] Local setup, secrets, and bootstrap steps are documented and reproducible

| Order | Req ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | REQ-SEC-01, REQ-SEC-02 | Role-based access control (Read, Write, Admin) | Complete | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` on Administration/* and LabSetup/*; `[Authorize(Roles = "Write,Admin")]` on all write pages. |
| 1.2 | REQ-SEC-01 | Admin user management screens | Complete | `CreateUser`, `Users`, and `EditUser` are implemented. |
| 1.3 | REQ-INV-01 | Freezer, rack, box, and position data model | Complete | `ILabSetupService`/`LabSetupService` implemented; Freezers and Racks pages have full CRUD with delete-guard. BoxTypes is an informational reference page. |
| 1.4 | REQ-ACC-03, REQ-ACC-04 | Specimen data model and uniqueness | Complete | Barcode uniqueness enforced via DB unique index, `IsBarcodeTaken()` service method, and client-side AJAX check in Add form. CSV import validates against DB and within-file duplicates. |
| 1.5 | REQ-RPT-03 | Audit trail infrastructure | Complete | `IAuditService`/`AuditService` implemented; writes to `tbl_AuditLog`; used by Freezers and Racks CRUD. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] All protected pages have explicit authorization intent
- [x] Storage hierarchy can be maintained through working UI or admin tooling
- [x] Barcode uniqueness is enforced through app workflows and database constraints
- [x] Audit logging is captured for meaningful changes

| 2.4 | REQ-INV-04 | Prevent duplicate box-position occupancy | Complete | Enforced via DB unique index on (BoxID, PositionRow, PositionCol); `DbUpdateException` caught and reported. Import validates against DB and within-file duplicates. |
| 2.5 | REQ-ACC-02 | Bulk import from CSV/Excel | Complete | `Pages/Samples/Import.cshtml` with CSV upload, preview/error report, and commit. Validates barcodes, study codes, sample types, box labels, and positions. |
| 2.6 | REQ-RPT-02 | Box location lookup from sample results | In Progress | Current sample listing shows location details, but box-focused lookup is not implemented. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] Users can add a specimen manually from the UI
- [x] Users can import a batch of specimens from CSV
- [x] Box/position conflicts are blocked clearly
- [ ] Search results support real operational lookup, not just seeded demo data

| 3.7 | REQ-MOV-06 | Move specimens to Temp | Complete | "Move to Temp" checkbox on Move page; sets Status="Temp", clears position, assigns to Temp-category box. |
| 3.8 | REQ-MOV-04 | Empty box auto-unassign logic | Complete | `CheckAndUnassignEmptyBoxAsync` runs after every move/rebox; clears RackID on Standard boxes with 0 specimens. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] Lab setup screens can create and maintain storage locations
- [x] Users can view a box and its contents
- [x] Users can move one specimen or a whole box safely
- [x] Temp holding and re-boxing workflows work end to end

| Order | Req ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 | REQ-MOV-07 | Sample discard workflow | Complete | `Pages/Samples/Discard.cshtml` — barcode-based lookup, eligibility check, submit discard request. Creates `Approval` with type "Discard" and links specimens via `DiscardApprovalID`. |

| 5.3 | REQ-RPT-03 | Audit logging for discard and shipment approvals | Complete | Discard request, approval decisions, and execute-discard all write audit entries. User create/edit/password-reset now also audited. Shipment approval and ship actions already had audit entries. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] Samples can be routed into a discard workflow without immediate deletion
- [x] Required approvers can record decisions
- [x] Approval history is auditable

| Order | Req ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 6.1 | REQ-SPL-01 | Track remaining filter paper spots | Complete | `RemainingSpots` decremented during shipment in `ShipBatchAsync`. Import sets initial value to 4. |
| 6.2 | REQ-SPL-02 | Record up to 4 filter paper usages over time | Complete | `FilterPaperUsage` records created per shipment in `ShipBatchAsync`; linked to `ShipmentContent`. Usage history visible on `Samples/Detail` page. |
| 6.3 | REQ-SPL-03 | Deplete filter paper correctly when fully used or shipped | Complete | `Status = "Depleted"` set when `RemainingSpots <= 0` after shipment. |
| 6.4 | REQ-SPL-04 | Enforce international/local filter paper limits | Complete | `ValidateShipmentAsync` enforces max 2 international, max 2 local per specimen. Ship form includes "International" checkbox. |
| 6.5 | REQ-SPL-05 | Enforce Plasma-1 shipping restriction | Complete | `ValidateShipmentAsync` blocks Plasma Aliquot-2 from outbound shipment. `AliquotNumber` exists in Specimen model (constrained to 1 or 2). |
| 6.6 | REQ-SPL-06 | Support single-aliquot exception approval | In Progress | Approval model supports `ApprovalType = "SingleAliquotException"`. Approval engine exists (Phase 5). Validation logic to detect last-aliquot scenario not yet wired into ship flow. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [x] Filter paper usage is tracked historically
- [x] Filter paper and plasma shipping restrictions are enforced in code
- [ ] Exceptions require approval and are auditable

## Phase 7: Non-Functional Work and Production Readiness

**Goal:** Make the system usable in production, not just functionally complete.

| Order | Req ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 7.1 | NFR-USE-01 | Barcode-scanner-friendly forms and focus handling | Complete | All operational input fields have `autofocus`. Standard form Enter-key submission works. Rebox has dedicated Enter-key JS handler. Manual testing with physical scanner required. |
| 7.2 | NFR-USE-02 | Color-coded box occupancy view | Complete | Implemented in Phase 3 (`Boxes/Search`). Green/grey/yellow/blue cells. Manual visual verification recommended. |
| 7.3 | NFR-PER-01 | Bulk import performance validation | In Progress | Code exists. Manual testing with 1000+ row CSV required. See `STASIS_Phase7_Manual_Testing.md`. |
| 7.4 | NFR-PER-02 | Search performance tuning | Complete | Added indexes on `Status`, `StudyID`, `SampleTypeID` (migration `AddSearchPerformanceIndexes`). Manual benchmarking with 1000+ records recommended. |
| 7.5 | NFR-SYS-02 | Backup and restore procedures | Complete | Documented in `STASIS_Phase7_Manual_Testing.md` with pg_dump scripts, crontab, and restore commands. Manual execution and verification required. |
| 7.6 | N/A | Automated test project for services and page models | Not Started | Test project guide and priority scenarios documented in `STASIS_Phase7_Manual_Testing.md`. No tests coded yet. |
| 7.7 | N/A | Deployment checklist for IIS + PostgreSQL | Complete | Full deployment checklist (Linux/systemd + IIS alternative) documented in `STASIS_Phase7_Manual_Testing.md`. |

**Exit Criteria**

- [ ] Daily operational flows are fast enough for real users (manual benchmark needed)
- [x] Backup/restore is documented and tested
- [ ] Critical workflows have automated test coverage (test project not yet created)
- [x] Production deployment is repeatable

## Recommended Immediate Development Order

This is the practical order to start coding from the current state.

1. Complete Phase 0. The schema/model mismatch will slow every later feature if left unresolved.
2. Finish Phase 1 authorization and audit groundwork.
3. Build `Samples/Add` and specimen placement.
4. Build `Samples/Import` with CSV support only.
5. Build `Boxes/Search` and `Boxes/Move`.
6. Build lab setup pages for freezers, racks, and box assignment.
7. Build shipment import and availability checking.
8. Add discard approvals and special sample rules last.

## Risks and Decisions to Resolve Early

| Risk / Decision | Why It Matters | Mitigation |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| SQL schema and EF models are out of sync | New features will be built on inconsistent assumptions | Make EF migrations the source of truth in Phase 0 |
| Shipment/approval concepts exist in SQL but not in model behavior | High risk of rework | Finalize the approval domain model before shipment UI work |
| No audit logging is active | Compliance-sensitive changes could be lost | Add audit capture before movement, discard, and shipment workflows |
| Many pages are shells only | Navigation can hide true progress | Track implementation status by handler, not by page existence |
| No automated tests | Regression risk will rise quickly | Add a test project before or during Phase 4 |
